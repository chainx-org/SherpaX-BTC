# SherpaX-BTC

## Background
After BTC taproot is upgraded, it brings two major technologies: MAST contract + aggregate signature.
It brings a new safe technical solution to the distributed privacy and safe computing threshold signature.
It also brings a decentralized (multi-signature escrow node can be enough) cross-chain solution to BTC.

## Technical Summary
- Threshold signature wallet: Trusted environment based on distributed privacy and secure multi-party computing,
Implement aggregate signature algorithm.
- Mechanism of Trusted Custodian Based on Game Theory.

## [Threshold signature wallet](https://github.com/coming-chat/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/threshold_signature.md)
ComingChat uses its own private communication network and taproot's technology to realize a threshold signature wallet.
